# Star Wars App

## About

An app that allows users to create an account and then log in and draw 'their' planet from the Star Wars universe ([Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/)). The plan is to store only the last drawing result in the database and overwrite it with the new result. Optionally adding a dark mode.
